The CSV file was generated with `make approx`. For each n, k, we generate iters number of random Gaussian matrices and compute the average and standard deviation of the fourth moment.
This uses the avg-fourth-moment.cpp and methods.cpp files.


The lexb.cpp file was used to check some of the formulas in Adam's old note.

To Do: now that we're not really using the lexb.cpp file, clean up the code and clean up the makefile.
