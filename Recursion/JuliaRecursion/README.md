## IMPORTANT!

I ran the Julia code `recursion.jl` up to n=40. Unfortunately, `JuliaRecursion/computedG.csv` is very large now (about 198 MB), and `git push` is freezing so I can't upload the full file to GitHub. 

The current `JuliaRecursion/computedG.csv` file on GitHub goes only to n=9. The file that contains up to n=40 is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sCdtR_jjV6ohsK2928Ki3WuEgbaKxJkt?usp=share_link). 

The easiest way to play around with the expressions is to clone the repo, download the `computedG.csv` file from Drive and replace the `JuliaRecursion/computedG.csv` file with it, then run `Analysis/sanityChecks.nb`.
