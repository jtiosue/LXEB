## IMPORTANT!

I've run the Julia code `recursionIO.jl` up to n=30. Unfortunately, `Julia/computedG.csv` is very large now (about 35 MB), and `git push` is freezing so I can't upload the full file to GitHub. 

I'll figure out how to do this later. But for now, the current `Julia/computedG.csv` file on GitHub goes only to n=9. The file that contains up to n=30 is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sCdtR_jjV6ohsK2928Ki3WuEgbaKxJkt?usp=share_link). 

The easiest way to play around with the expressions is to clone the repo, download the `computedG.csv` file from Drive and replace the `Julia/computedG.csv` file with it, then run `Julia/playingAround.nb`.
